# Ruby_AICC Plugin
This plugin will allow you to use ruby objects to send and store commands from AICC courseware. The latest version of AICC was released in August of 2004 (Version 4.0). This plugin will attempt to encapsulate functionality defined in the specification document http://www.aicc.org/docs/tech/cmi001v4.pdf.

This plugin will mostly be of use to learning tracking systems.
